## August 26, 2025: Property Detail Page - V2 Enhancement

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**

### Feature/Fix Implemented:
The Property Detail page (`/properties/:id`) has been successfully enhanced and stabilized. This update addressed critical data loading issues and improved the user interface.

### Key Changes:

1.  **Backend Data Integrity**:
    *   Resolved a critical bug where the API was failing due to a mismatch between the database schema (`property_description`) and the data access code (`description`).
    *   The `get_property_by_id_from_db` function in `properties_crud.py` now correctly queries for `property_description`.
    *   The `Property` data model in `property_models.py` was updated to include the `description` field, fixing a server-side serialization error.

2.  **Frontend UI/UX Overhaul**:
    *   The `PropertyDetail.vue` component now correctly displays the property's detailed description and a list of its features.
    *   The UI has been standardized to use Element Plus icons exclusively, creating a more consistent and professional appearance.
    *   Redundant UI elements have been removed, resulting in a cleaner page layout.

### Outcome:
The Property Detail page is now robust, correctly displays all intended data from the backend, and has a significantly improved user interface. The API endpoint `/api/properties/{id}` is stable and fully verified. This work completes the requirements outlined in `implementation_plan.md`.
