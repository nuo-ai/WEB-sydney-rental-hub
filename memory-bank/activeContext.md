# Active Context & Immediate Focus

This document outlines the current state of development, recent decisions, and the immediate focus for the Sydney Rental Hub project. It's the most dynamic part of the Memory Bank, designed to provide an instant snapshot of "what's happening right now."

## 1. Current Task: Property Detail Page Enhancement & Bug Fix

**Objective**: To implement the fixes and enhancements for the Property Detail page as detailed in `implementation_plan.md`.

**Status**: **COMPLETED**.

### Summary of Work Done:

1.  **Backend (`properties_crud.py`)**:
    *   Corrected the SQL query in `get_property_by_id_from_db` to fetch the `property_description` column from the database.
    *   Used the `AS description` alias in the SQL query to ensure compatibility with the existing `Property` model and frontend components, avoiding widespread refactoring.

2.  **Model (`property_models.py`)**:
    *   Added the missing `description: Optional[str] = None` field to the `Property` strawberry model. This resolved a `500 Internal Server Error` that occurred during object instantiation due to the backend trying to populate a non-existent field.

3.  **Frontend (`PropertyDetail.vue`)**:
    *   Integrated the display of the `description` and `property_features` fields.
    *   Refactored UI elements to use Element Plus icons (`<el-icon>`) for a consistent look and feel, replacing all previous Font Awesome `<i>` tags.
    *   Cleaned up the template by removing redundant or placeholder elements.

### Key Learnings & Decisions:

*   **Database Schema Drift**: A critical bug was caused by a mismatch between the database schema (which uses `property_description`) and the application's data access layer (which was incorrectly trying to query `description`). This highlights the need for a more robust schema validation or migration process.
*   **Targeted Fixes**: Using `AS` in SQL and adding a single field to the model proved to be an effective, low-impact strategy to fix the data flow without requiring major changes to the frontend or Pydantic models.
*   **API Verification is Crucial**: Direct API verification using `curl` was essential in diagnosing the problem progression from a `404 Not Found` to a `500 Internal Server Error`, and finally to a `200 OK`.

## 2. System State & Next Steps

*   **Backend API**: The `/api/properties/{id}` endpoint is now stable and correctly serving all required data for the Property Detail page.
*   **Frontend**: The `PropertyDetail.vue` component is visually and functionally complete according to the implementation plan.
*   **Next Immediate Step**: The final step is to update the `progress.md` file to reflect the completion of this task cycle. After that, the task can be marked as fully complete.

## 3. Active Architectural Considerations

*   **Redis Caching**: During debugging, it was noted that the inability to connect to a Redis instance generates significant log noise. While not addressed in this task, a future improvement could be to make the Redis cache connection more resilient or to allow it to be gracefully disabled via an environment variable if not available, preventing startup errors or log spam.
