基本工作流程

从待办事项列表开始：

待办事项列表中有 6 个文件。我们将逐一完成它们。

您对一个功能的工作是首先将文件从待办事项列表移动到 1_planning，然后添加 stage_gate_plan。然后您将实现该功能和 stage_gate_plan。

在完成之后，您将在同一个请求中继续，将已创建的文件夹移动到 2_in_progress 并添加 stage_gate_prod

然后，一旦完成，您将把已完成的功能文件夹移动到 3_completed/
触发完成阶段门

Basic Workflow

Start in the Backlog:

There is 6 files in the backlog. we are going to complete them 1 by 1.

your job for a feature is to first move the file to the 1_planning from the backlog and then add stage_gate_plan. You will then implement that feature and the stage_gate_plan.

In the same request you will move on after that is completed, by moving the folder that has been created to 2_in_progress and add stage_gate_prod

then once that has been done you will move the completed feature folder to 3_completed/
Trigger the completion stage gate
