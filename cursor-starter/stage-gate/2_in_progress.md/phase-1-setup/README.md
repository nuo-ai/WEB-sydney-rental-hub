# Phase 1 Setup Feature

## Goal
Prepare the existing T3 project environment for dashboard development by verifying core setup, integrating UI components, and installing necessary dependencies.

## Key Requirements
- Verify T3 Stack configuration (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, tRPC/API routes)
- Integrate shadcn/ui component library 
- Review and plan project structure for dashboard-specific code
- Install core dependencies for charting and drag-and-drop functionality
- Ensure proper configuration of Recharts for data visualisation
- Set up React Grid Layout for dashboard widgets

## Target Audience
**Primary:** Full-stack developers working on T3 Stack projects
**Secondary:** Project leads and technical architects planning dashboard implementations

## Open Questions
- Which specific charting components from Recharts will be most suitable for the intended dashboard use cases?
- Should the drag-and-drop grid layout be implemented with persistence (saving layout preferences)?
- Are there any existing project-specific configurations that might conflict with shadcn/ui integration?
- What is the preferred folder structure convention for dashboard components within the T3 project structure?
