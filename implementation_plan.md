# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Upgrade the property list layout from the current single-column display to a modern, responsive multi-column grid to significantly improve the user experience on tablet and desktop screens.

This enhancement directly addresses the feedback that the current desktop layout feels empty and "stuck to the left." By implementing a multi-column grid that adapts to various screen sizes, we will create a more professional, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly interface that aligns with industry best practices for responsive web design. The changes will be focused on CSS modifications and will not alter any component logic.

[Files]
This plan involves modifying the CSS rules in three key files to create the responsive grid system.

-   **`vue-frontend/src/style.css` (Modified)**
    -   The primary responsive logic for the grid will be centralized here. We will modify the existing `@media (min-width: 768px)` rule and add new rules for larger breakpoints.
-   **`vue-frontend/src/views/HomeView.vue` (Modified)**
    -   The local, scoped styles for `.properties-grid` that enforce a single-column layout will be removed to prevent conflicts with the new global rules.
-   **`vue-frontend/src/components/PropertyCard.vue` (Modified)**
    -   The hardcoded `width: 580px;` will be removed to allow the property card to adapt fluidly to the width of its grid column.

[Functions]
No new, modified, or removed functions are required for this layout upgrade.

[Classes]
No new, modified, or removed component classes are required for this layout upgrade.

[Dependencies]
No new dependencies are required for this layout upgrade.

[Testing]
The testing for this task will be primarily visual and manual, verifying the layout at different screen sizes.

-   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Confirm layout at `width < 768px`: Should remain a single, full-width column.
    2.  Confirm layout at `768px <= width < 1024px`: Should be a centered, single column.
    3.  Confirm layout at `1024px <= width < 1440px`: Should be a centered, two-column grid.
    4.  Confirm layout at `width >= 1440px`: Should be a centered, three-column grid.
    5.  Ensure proper spacing (gap) between grid items at all breakpoints.

[Implementation Order]
The changes will be implemented in a specific order to ensure styles are applied correctly and avoid specificity conflicts.

1.  **Modify `PropertyCard.vue`**: First, remove the fixed `width: 580px` from the `.property-card` style to make it flexible.
2.  **Modify `HomeView.vue`**: Second, remove the scoped `display: flex` and related styles from the `.properties-grid` to avoid overriding the new global grid styles.
3.  **Modify `style.css`**: Finally, implement the new responsive `display: grid` rules in the global stylesheet. This ensures the new grid system is the final authority on the layout.
