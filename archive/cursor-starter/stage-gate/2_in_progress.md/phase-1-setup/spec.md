# Phase 1 Setup - Technical Specification

## Functionality Overview
The Phase 1 Setup feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for a T3 Stack dashboard application. This includes environment verification, component library integration, and dependency installation.

## Technical Scope

### Core Verification Tasks
- **T3 Stack Validation:** Automated checks for Next.js routing, TypeScript compilation, Tailwind CSS processing, and tRPC endpoint functionality
- **Environment Configuration:** Ensure development and build scripts are properly configured
- **Database Connection:** Verify any existing database connections (if applicable to project)

### Component Integration
- **shadcn/ui Setup:** Initialize component library with project-specific theme configuration
- **Component Registry:** Establish component import patterns and usage conventions
- **Theme Customisation:** Configure colour schemes, typography, and spacing to match project requirements

### Dependency Management
- **Chart Library:** Install and configure Recharts with TypeScript definitions
- **Grid System:** Set up React Grid Layout with proper type definitions
- **Utility Libraries:** Install any additional utilities for state management or data processing

## UI Treatment Options

### Option 1: Setup Wizard Interface
**Approach:** Step-by-step guided setup with progress indication
- Multi-step modal or full-page wizard
- Progress bar showing completion status
- Validation feedback for each step
- "Skip" options for already-configured items

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros:** User-friendly, clear progression, built-in validation
- **Cons:** More complex to implement, may be overkill for developers
- **Best for:** Teams with mixed technical experience levels

### Option 2: CLI-Based Setup Script
**Approach:** Command-line interface with interactive prompts
- Single command execution: `pnpm run setup:dashboard`
- Interactive prompts for configuration choices
- Automatic dependency installation and file generation
- Terminal output with colour-coded success/error messages

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros:** Fast execution, familiar to developers, easy to automate
- **Cons:** Less visual feedback, requires terminal comfort
- **Best for:** Experienced development teams, CI/CD integration

### Option 3: Configuration Dashboard
**Approach:** In-app setup page with real-time status monitoring
- Web-based interface within the application
- Live status indicators for each setup component
- One-click actions for individual setup tasks
- Detailed logs and troubleshooting information

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros:** Visual feedback, integrated experience, detailed logging
- **Cons:** Requires the app to be partially functional first
- **Best for:** Complex projects with multiple configuration dependencies
